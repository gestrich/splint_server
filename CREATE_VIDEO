Index File
  .m3u8
    An index file, or playlist, gives the clients the URLs of the media segment files.

    Apple provides a free tool to make
      media segment files and playlists from MPEG-4 video or QuickTime movies with H.264 video compression,


        Apple file segmenter
            Creates index file
                segments MPEG-2 transport stream into series of .ts files


                     Apple File Segmenter(MPEG-4) -> MPEG Stream, .m3u8 index file 

mediafilesegmenter
  File format for the file segmenter can be a QuickTime movie, MPEG-4 video, or MP3 audio, using the specified encoding.

  If you are re-encoding from a master file for video on demand, you can use a video editing tool such as Compressor.

variantplaylistcreator
  creates a master index file, or playlist, listing the index files for 
  alternate streams at different bit rates, using the output of the mediafilesegmenter. 
 
  The mediafilesegmenter must be invoked with the -generate-variant-playlist argument 
  to produce the required output for the variant playlist creator.

  Where possible, encode enough variants to provide the best quality stream across a 
  wide range of connection speeds. For example, encode variants at 150 kbps, 350 kbps, 
  550 kbps, 900 kbps, 1500 kbps.

  A 150k stream for the cellular variant playlist is recommended.

  A 240k or 440k stream for the Wi-Fi variant playlist is recommended.

  H.264 High Profile 4.1: iPad 2 and later and iPhone 4S and later. 

  A frame rate of 10 fps is recommended for video streams under 200 kbps. For video streams 
  under 300 kbps, a frame rate of 12 to 15 fps is recommended. For all other streams, a frame 
  rate of 29.97 is recommended.

  If your app uses HTTP Live Streaming over cellular networks, you are required to provide at 
  least one stream at 64 Kbps or lower bandwidth (the low-bandwidth stream may be audio-only 
  or audio with a still image)

  QUICK STEPS to adding new video
  **************************************** 
  -Make video with Quicktime and export in right format
    -Choose "export", "iPad, iPhone, iPod..."
    -Select "iPad, iPhone 4, Apple TV
    -Creates file such as Untitled.m4v
  -Convert m4v file to MPEG-2 Audio stream
    -Create directory where video will reside (ex stream2)
    -Run mediafilesegmenter which will put all files in created directory
      mediafilesegmenter -f stream3 Untitled.m4v 
  -Edit the video_index.json and add a reference to newly created .m3u8 file
